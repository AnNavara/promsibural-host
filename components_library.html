  <span class="tag">[main, article, sectoion]</span>
  <p>The main element is an exact analogue of ARIA's role="main", and is designed to show screenreaders and assistive technologies exactly where main content begins, so it can be a target for a "skip links" keyboard command, for example. It could also be used for content syndication (Instapaper-ish things) mobile browsers could zoom in on main when encountering non-responsive websites.It should therefore be used once per page. If you use something like(or similar, such as ), simply replace that with .</p>

Examples include chapters in a book, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, contact information.</p>

  <span class="tag">[aside]</span>

  <p>The figure element can be used to annotate illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc., that are referenced in the main content of the document, but that could, without affecting the flow of the document, be moved away from that primary content — e.g., to the side of the page, to dedicated pages, or to an appendix.</p>
  <p>The figcaption element represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents of the figcaption element's parent figure element, if any.</p>
